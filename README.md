# Data Science Nanodegree Project – Nutrient Analysis and Energy Prediction

## Introduction

This repository contains the first project of the **Data Science Nanodegree (DSND)** program.  
The goal is to explore and model nutritional data, performing data analysis, preprocessing, and predictive modeling to understand how different nutrients contribute to total energy content.

## Dataset

The dataset comes from [FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets), an open database that provides detailed information about food composition, including macro and micronutrients, for a wide range of food categories.

## Goals

- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships with the target variable.  
- To clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, outliers, and feature transformations).  
- To train and evaluate predictive models for estimating total energy.  
- To document methods, modeling decisions, and results in structured notebooks and reports.  
- To communicate findings in a clear, non-technical way through a public article.  

## Repository structure

- `data/`
  - `raw/` — original unmodified data.  
  - `processed/` — cleaned and feature-engineered data ready for analysis.  
- `/data_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebooks for EDA, experiments and reporting.  
- `models/` — trained models ans checkpoints.
- `README.md` — project overview and documentation.  

## Results and metrics

- Model performance metrics (e.g., MSE, RMSE, R²) are reported in `data_analysis.ipynb`.  
- Save trained models in `models/`.
- The non-technical summary and stakeholder communication are available in the accompanying article: [How Machine Learning Reveals What Really Powers Our Food](https://medium.com/@viniciusagsa/how-machine-learning-reveals-what-really-powers-our-food-e206945138a3).
